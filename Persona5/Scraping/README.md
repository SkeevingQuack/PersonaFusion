Compile_Personas has most of the Persona class code. Chunks of that are all I want. The actual scraping needs to be rewritten to be more robust

Errors.log is just translation errors, which seem to be completely made of dashes.

Personas.pickle currently has only persona names and slugs, or question marks where slugs should be.

Personas.txt is a file I'm just using to look at what is actually being accomplished. I might want to add slugs to the function that makes it and eventually do skills.

Slug.py and slugs.csv shouldn't be necessary anymore, they were just to get stuff from google sheets.
